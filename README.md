- Uses Jaccard similarity algorithm

## Technical Architecture

- **Backend**: Flask web framework with pandas for data processing
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 with vanilla JavaScript
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for CSV handling and data manipulation
- **Similarity Algorithm**: Jaccard similarity on skill tag overlap
- **Pagination**: Client-side pagination for smooth user experience

## Similarity Algorithm

The application uses **Jaccard similarity** to find similar jobs:

**Formula**: `|A ‚à© B| / |A ‚à™ B|`
- A = Skill tags of target job
- B = Skill tags of competitor job
- Result = Similarity score (0-100%)

**Example**:
- Target job: ["Finance", "Data Science"] 
- Competitor job: ["Finance"]
- Similarity: 1/(1+1) = 50%

## Customization

1. Add CSV file to `tagged/` directory
2. Update the `companies` dictionary in `app.py`
