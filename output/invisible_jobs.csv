Large‐scale language models are evolving from clever chatbots into powerful engines of scientific discovery. With high‐quality training data, tomorrow’s AI can democratize world‐class education, keep pace with cutting‐edge research, and streamline lab work for scientists everywhere. That training data begins with you—we need your expertise to help power the next generation of AI. We’re looking for analytical chemistry specialists who live and breathe spectroscopy, chromatography, electrochemical analysis, quantitative chemical analysis, environmental testing, pharmaceutical analysis, and analytical method development. You’ll challenge advanced language models on topics like mass spectrometry, HPLC and GC technique optimization, NMR interpretation, method validation, trace analysis, titrimetric methods, and QA/QC protocol design—documenting every failure mode so we can harden model reasoning. On a typical day, you will converse with the model on lab scenarios and theoretical analytical chemistry questions, verify factual accuracy and logical soundness, capture reproducible error traces, and suggest improvements to our prompt engineering and evaluation metrics. A PhD in analytical chemistry or a closely related chemical science field is ideal; peer‐reviewed publications, lab-based method development, regulatory testing, or instrumentation-intensive research signal fit. Clear, metacognitive communication—“showing your work”—is essential. Ready to turn your analytical chemistry expertise into the knowledge base for tomorrow’s AI? Apply today and start teaching the model that will teach the world. We offer a pay range of $8‐to‐$65 per hour, with the exact rate determined after evaluating your experience, expertise, and geographic location.
